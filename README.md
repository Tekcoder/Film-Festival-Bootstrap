# Film-Festival-Bootstrap

This is one of the numerous projects that I worked on being a beneficiary of Facebook Developer Circles scholarship with Openclassrooms on the Front-End Developer Path. The project is about creating a website for a film agency in the Boston area of US. The website should enable them to display the films that will be shown, an announcement page and a contact page for registration
My steps in creating this intuitive website using a Bootstrap 4 are:

    Used a CDN
    Using Built-In Bootstrap classes
    Customization so that it actually feels like their brand is well-represented.
